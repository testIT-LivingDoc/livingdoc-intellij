![testIT LivingDoc IntelliJ Plugin](documentation/images/livingdoc-intellij.png)

LivingDoc is a powerful tool that supports implementing collaboration driven methods like Behavior Driven Development or Specification By Example. Due to its smart integration into Atlassian Confluence the comfortable editing possibilities of confluences can be used to write the feature specifications and the acceptance tests.

The LivingDoc Plugin for IntellIJ Idea makes it easier for developers to write, debug and execute automated acceptance tests in IntelliJ.
